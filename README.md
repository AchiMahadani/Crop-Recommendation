## Introduction
In agriculture, choosing the right crop for a particular field is crucial for maximizing productivity and sustainability. The Crop Recommendation System aims to predict the best crop to plant based on environmental and soil factors, helping farmers make informed decisions.

## Problem Statement
The problem is to develop a system that can recommend the most suitable crop for a particular piece of land based on factors such as soil type, temperature, rainfall, and pH levels.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that recommends the most appropriate crop for a given set of environmental conditions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- **N**: Nitrogen content in soil
- **P**: Phosphorus content in soil
- **K**: Potassium content in soil
- **Temperature**: The average temperature (in Â°C)
- **Humidity**: The relative humidity (in %)
- **pH**: pH value of the soil
- **Rainfall**: The amount of rainfall (in mm)

The target variable is the type of **crop** to be recommended.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Normalizing/standardizing the data
- Encoding categorical variables

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizing the distribution of soil and weather features
- Analyzing the correlation between features and crop yield
- Insights derived from patterns in data

### Model Selection
The models considered for this project include:
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Decision Tree**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Train the models using the dataset.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as GridSearchCV.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Results
- **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest achieved an accuracy of **94%**.
- **Confusion Matrix**: (Insert Confusion Matrix here)
- **ROC Curve**: (Insert ROC Curve here)
- A discussion on why this model performed better than others.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated a machine learning approach to crop recommendation based on environmental conditions. The model can significantly aid farmers in optimizing their crop selection for better yields.
